##  About The Project

Hi, I'm **Enes Furkan Kuş**. As a Backend Developer with a strong background in **.NET Core (Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS)**, I started this journey to understand Go not just syntactically, but **architecturally**.

This repository is not just a collection of snippets; it is a structured documentation of my transition to Cloud Native development. I explore how Go handles memory, concurrency, and data structures "under the hood" compared to the managed world of C#.
